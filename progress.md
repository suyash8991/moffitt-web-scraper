# Moffitt Cancer Center Project Progress Report

*Last updated: October 13, 2025*

## Project Status: Phase 1 (Web Scraping) â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–‘â–‘ 80%

### Completed Tasks

#### Web Scraping Framework
- âœ… Set up project structure with proper directory organization
- âœ… Implemented URL extraction from Excel file
- âœ… Created crawler module with rate limiting and error handling
- âœ… Added HTML â†’ Markdown conversion using Crawl4AI
- âœ… Developed parser to extract structured data from Markdown
- âœ… Designed schema for researcher profile validation
- âœ… Built modular components for easy maintenance
- âœ… Created unified pipeline for complete processing
- âœ… Set up Git repository with logical commits

#### Current Capabilities
- Can extract researcher profiles from the Moffitt Cancer Center website
- Parses key information including:
  - Name and degrees
  - Title and position
  - Program affiliations
  - Research overview
  - Research interests
  - Education & training
  - Publications
  - Grants
  - Contact information
- Stores data in three formats:
  - Raw HTML (for archival purposes)
  - Markdown (for readability)
  - Structured JSON (for processing)

### In Progress

- Running the full scraper on all 127 researcher profiles
- Refining parser for edge cases and unusual profile formats
- Validating data quality across all extracted profiles

### Next Steps

- Complete scraping and validation of all researcher profiles
- Generate summary statistics on research areas and departments
- Begin Phase 2: Setting up the vector database and embeddings
- Start planning the agentic orchestration layer

## Data Statistics

*These statistics will be populated after processing all researcher profiles*

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Total Researchers | 127 |
| Researchers Processed | 2 |
| Research Programs | TBD |
| Departments | TBD |
| Total Publications | TBD |
| Research Areas | TBD |

## Challenges & Solutions

### Current Challenges
- **Varying profile formats**: Some researcher profiles have different section organizations
  - *Solution*: Enhanced parser to handle multiple section formats

- **Rate limiting needs**: Need to respect Moffitt's servers
  - *Solution*: Implemented random delays between requests (2-5 seconds)

### Upcoming Challenges
- Creating accurate embeddings for diverse researcher text
- Developing an orchestrator that can understand user intent
- Building a reasoning layer that provides accurate, cited responses

## Focus for Next Week
- Complete scraping and processing of all researcher profiles
- Begin setting up the vector database infrastructure
- Research optimal embedding models for researcher text
- Start designing the agentic orchestration layer
