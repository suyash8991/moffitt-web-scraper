  * ## Overview
Dr. Baz’s research is to develop and investigate new therapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. 
### Associations
    * Malignant Hematology
    * Pentecost Family Myeloma Research Center
    * Molecular Medicine Program
### Education & Training
**Board Certification:**
    * Internal Medicine - Hematology
**Residency:**
    * Cleveland Clinic Foundation - Internal Medicine
    * Cleveland Clinic Foundation - Hematology and Medical Oncology
**Medical School:**
    * American University of Beirut - MD
  * ## Research Interest
Dr. Baz is a very active researcher in the field and specifically, he has an interest in clinical trials investigating new agents for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In addition, Dr. Baz collaborates closely with many different investigators within the Moffitt Myeloma Working Group (MMWG) and within the myeloma scientific community in general with the goal of improving outcomes of patients with plasma cell dyscrasias. For example, most of the currently approved agents in the myeloma field have been evaluated at Moffitt in phase I and II clinical trials.
