  * ## Overview
The main theme of the Monteiro lab is the integration of epidemiological, genomic, and proteomics datasets to explore the role of genetic variation on cancer predisposition, development, and treatment. We apply a systems biology approach to three interconnected problems in cancer.

  * ## Research Interest
First, we aim to understand how rare genetic variation impacts on signal transduction networks and its role in inherited cancer syndromes. We focus on the role of BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 in cancer and integrate statistical, structural, and functional data to aid in clinical annotation of thousands of variants found in the population. Our group pioneered the use of functional assays to analyze mutations in the BRCA1 BRCT domain and has developed computation models to predict their functional impact. These approaches have a significant impact in the classification of a large number of genetic variants for which cancer association could not be determined by genetic approaches alone. We have also developed interactive visualization tools to functionally annotate variants in cancer predisposition genes (http://iscva.moffitt.org/fyi-hboc/build/). Second, we seek to understand how BRCT domains convey signals during the cellular response to DNA Damage. We combine detailed literature curation, large scale yeast two-hybrid screening and tandem-affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry to generate an annotated protein-protein interaction network mediated by all BRCT domains in the human proteome. We aim to use these protein-protein interaction maps as drug and target discovery platform. Finally, we are interested in the mechanism underlying cancer risk conferred by common genetic variants. We played an active role in the NIH/NCI GAME-ON (Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology; http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/gameon/) consortium as part of the cross-GAME-ON Functional Working group. We have developed a conceptual framework and a bioinformatics and functional assay platforms to systematically interrogate cancer predisposition loci revealed by GWAS of unprecedented sample sizes. We apply this analytical framework to loci conferring risk for brain, breast, ovarian, and testicular cancer.
