  * ## Research Interest
Our laboratory is interested in implementing new immunotherapeutic strategies in the field of malignant hematology. The major focus of the lab has been on developing immunotherapeutic approaches for acute and chronic leukemias as well as MDS. Basic research ongoing projects include: 1) epigenetic modulation to increase the immunogenicity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 2) serological identification of cancer testis antigen in hematological malignancies. 3) Effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the immune system of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 4) Mechanisms of immune resistance mediated by stroma interactions in CML. 5) NOG humanized mice models to study the immune system and therapeutics of hematological malignant disorders.Clinical translational ongoing and future projects includes: 1) A WT1 peptide vaccine study in patients with MDS and AML after remission. 2) A combination of a bystander vaccine (K562/GM/CD40L) in combination with lenalidomide for patients with high risk MDS as well for CLL and CML.
