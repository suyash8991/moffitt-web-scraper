  * ## Overview
During my time as a researcher in the field of cancer I have focused on evaluating outcomes and health systems to improve quality of cancer care. This is a field that is best suited to study in the context of the infrastructure of a cancer center which among other things provides the opportunity for multidisciplinary expertise and collaboration.

  * ## Research Interest
Research Interests:1. Improve regionalization of care and access to high-quality care for hepatobiliary malignancies: There is a well-described association with institutional procedural volume and postoperative outcomes (mortality) following cancer surgery, which has been used to drive regionalization of care for specific procedures. My interest lies in evaluating institutional processes beyond procedural volume, and the effect these have on postoperative AND cancer-related outcomes, including survival. Further, I have experience developing regional-type interventions that facilitate access to high-volume centers across different states and proven positive impact on both the process of care and cancer outcomes.2. Patient-centered outcomes following cancer surgery in the elderly population: I have experience using Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) to evaluate geriatric conditions and risks following surgery in the geriatric population (previously funded work through ASCO CDA). I intent to expand this to the surgical population and develop interventions that will improve postoperative, patient-centered and cancer-related outcomes.
