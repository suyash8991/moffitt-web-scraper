  * ## Overview
At Moffitt, The Binning Lab will apply cutting-edge biochemical and structural techniques to identify new pathogenic mechanisms employed by oncogenic human papilloma viruses (HPV) that are drivers of cervical and head and neck cancers. The fundamental work that will be pursued in Dr. Binning’s laboratory will inform the development of diagnostics and therapeutics for these cancers. 
### Associations
    * Gynecologic Oncology
    * Molecular Oncology
    * Cancer Biology & Evolution Program
### Education & Training
**Graduate:**
    * Iowa State University, PhD - Biochemistry
  * ## Research Interest
The Binning lab studies how viruses such as Human Papillomavirus (HPV) re-wire host ubiquitin machinery to support viral replication and drive tumorigenesis. By exploring the link between human disease states and dysregulation of ubiquitin pathways, we aim to identify new pathogenic mechanisms that will guide the development of diagnostics and therapeutics.
