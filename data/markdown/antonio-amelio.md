  * ## Overview
The Amelio Lab is a cancer cell biology lab focused on discovering the molecular mechanisms that drive tumor development and progression.
### Associations
    * Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis
    * Head and Neck-Endocrine Oncology
    * Cancer Biology & Evolution Program
  * ## Research Interest
We use an interdisciplinary approach that integrates a combination of bioinformatics, genetically engineered cell line and animal models, pharmacologic and molecular genetic analyses, and synthetic biology approaches to investigate tumor development and progression and identify therapeutic vulnerabilities.
