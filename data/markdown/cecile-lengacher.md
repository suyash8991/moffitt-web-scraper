  * ## Overview
Dr. Cecile Lengacher's funded research focuses on Psychoneuroimmunology and complementary/alternative interventions for women with breast cancer.
### Associations
    * Health Outcomes & Behavior Program
### Education & Training
**Graduate:**
    * Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, MSN - Medical Surgical Nursing Education
    * Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, PhD - Educational Psychology Emphasis on Statistics and Research
**Continuing Education:**
    * Carthage College, Kenosha, Wisconsin - Education Certification
    * University of Wisconsin, Menomonie, Wisconsin - Educational Administration Certification
    * Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois - Post Master's Studies in Psychiatric Nursing, Nursing Theory, Nursing Research
  * ## Research Interest
Dr. Lengacher’s research includes women’s health, psycho-oncology, psychoneuroimmunology, and complementary alternative medicine. This expertise spans basic science to clinical research. An important aspect of her psycho-oncology research is symptom management through delivery of complementary alternative medicine therapies. She is currently conducting an NCI-funded study examining the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on symptom management and biomarkers such as cytokines, stress hormones, and cellular adhesion markers.
