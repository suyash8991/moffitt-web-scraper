  * ## Overview
As a scholar in the field of health disparities, community-engaged research, health literacy, and cancer research education and training, my research aims to advance the effective application of community-academic models for beneficial community health through participatory-centric approaches. Enduring cornerstones of my endeavors are developing trustworthy collaborations, and maintaining a deep appreciation for diverse perspectives and insights gained from others to achieve goals. Moreover, my work is driven by an intentional integration of cultural and literacy features. Another emphasis of my work is the development of innovative training programs that embody mentoring, networking, and collaboration with a goal of engaging individuals from underrepresented groups in the biomedical and behavioral sciences, and to spark their curiosity about the possibilities, potential and actualities of careers in cancer research.

  * ## Research Interest
My research interests support the promotion of cancer prevention/early detection and health equity. Influenced by a social justice framework with an eye towards intersectionality and a health equity lens for examining social determinants of health, my work emphasizes the tenets of catchment relevant research, team science, and community partnership engagement. My efforts in establishing the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network founded in 2005 as part of NCI's Community Networks Program has led to invaluable understanding of the requisite features of beneficial community-clinical academic research partnerships. Current studies aim to accelerate the adoption of cancer prevention screening strategies through implementation science (real-world practice) focusing on multiple system levels: organizational, provider, and patient level to boost colorectal cancer screening rates in Federally Qualified Health Centers in central and SE Florida.
