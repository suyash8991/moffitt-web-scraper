  * ## Overview
### Associations
    * Molecular Oncology & Drug Discovery Program
    * Molecular Medicine Program
### Education & Training
**Graduate:**
    * Washington University of St. Louis, PhD - Bioorganic Chemistry
**Fellowship:**
    * Yale University - Bioorganic Chemistry
  * ## Research Interest
The research in our laboratory ia focused on the expansion of interdisciplinary research at the interface of chemistry and biology to discover novel peptidomimetics and other small molecules that modulate protein-protein interactions involved in critical cellular processes. Understanding how these compounds interact with proteins will help to reveal mechanisms governing cell activities. We are particularly interested in developing compounds that lead to the design of novel therapeutics potentially targeting cancer, HIV, and Alzheimer's disease, etc.
