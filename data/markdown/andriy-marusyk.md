  * ## Overview
The main focus of research in my lab is filling this gap through development of experimental models that allow characterization and quantification of dynamics of populations of cancers cells under base-like conditions as well as under the stress of anti-cancer therapies. Another major research effort is centered on characterization of interactions between malignant cells and tumor associated fibroblasts with the aim of developing means to overcome stromal resistance to anti-cancer therapies.

  * ## Research Interest
Tumors are mini eco-systems, where evolving populations of genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous malignant cells are engaged in a network of reciprocal interactions with multiple normal cell types as well as with non-cellular components of tumor micro and macro environment. Research over recent decades shed light on molecular pathways essential for cancer cell survival, leading to development of multiple novel therapeutic approaches. Unfortunately, almost in all cases anti-cancers therapies provide only a temporary success, as tumors eventually relapse owing to outgrowth of therapy-resistant phenotypes. Preventing and limiting this outgrowth cannot be achieved only by focusing on proximal molecular mechanisms of resistance. We also need to develop adequate level of understanding of evolutionary dynamics, a knowledge that is mostly lacking.
