  * ## Overview
My research focus is on improving the surgical and radiosurgical treatment of primary and metastatic brain and spine tumors. My research includes understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive the formation of primary and metastatic brain tumors, including cancer stem cells. I am also interested in developing and trialing targeted therapies that improve the medical control of brain tumors. I am also interested in advancing surgical technologies that will improve outcomes for primary and metastatic spine tumors. These in include minimally invasive techniques that allow for maximal survival benefit and pain relief with minimal morbidity.
