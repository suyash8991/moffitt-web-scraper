  * ## Overview
Palliation in oncology; proton therapy.
### Associations
    * Radiation Oncology
    * Health Outcomes and Behavior
    * Health Outcomes & Behavior Program
### Education & Training
**Internship:**
    * National Naval Medical Center - Imtern
**Board Certification:**
**Residency:**
    * National Cancer Institute - Radiation Oncology
**Medical School:**
    * Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences - MD
  * ## Research Interest
Dr. Johnstone's recent focus has been divided between process analyses and survivorship issues: identification of the impact of cancer or its therapy on patients' quality of life, and then intervening to palliate toxicity. Of specific interest is the use of Integrative therapies in this regard. His group is now investigating complementary modalities with physiologic monitoring in such patients.
