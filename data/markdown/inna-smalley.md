  * ## Research Interest
Dr. Smalley has largely focused on developing novel therapeutic rationales for treating BRAF- and NRAS-mutant melanoma, with an emphasis on the role of the tumor microenvironment in drug resistance. This includes recent findings on the mechanisms of drug resistance in BRAF-mutant melanoma that rely on extracellular matrix remodeling and fibroblast activation. The current studies are focused on exploring how intra-tumoral heterogeneity facilitates tumor growth, drug resistance and dissemination, with a special focus on single cell analysis and metabolism-associated signaling. She would like to elucidate what drives tumor cells to certain metastatic sites, including the brain and leptomeninges, as well as the mechanism supporting their survival in different microenvironments. Dr. Smalley believes that the future treatment of melanoma lies in personalized, rational drug combinations that will turn a terminal disease into a manageable chronic illness. My career goal is to develop efficacious treatment strategies for patients with CNS metastasis and late-stage disease.
