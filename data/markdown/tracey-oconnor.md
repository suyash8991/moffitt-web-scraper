Tracey O'Connor, MD 
**Program:** Breast Oncology 
**Research Program:** Health Outcomes & Behavior Program 
  * ## Overview
My research interests include breast cancer management in the older patient, understanding and minimizing treatment toxicity, and modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity and diet that can influence quality of life and prognosis.
### Associations
    * Breast Oncology
    * Health Outcomes & Behavior Program
  * ## Research Interest
I am collaborating on a project examining respiratory muscle training to mitigate toxicity during neo/adjuvant chemotherapy. I am submitting an application (LOI accepted) to the Gateway Foundation for a project looking at de-escalation of neoadjuvant therapy in older adults with HER 2 positive breast cancer.
