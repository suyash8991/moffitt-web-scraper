  * ## Overview
As a physician-scientist, with clinical and basic research expertise in hematologic malignancies, Dr. Yun's scientific career is dedicated to understanding and targeting molecular circuits that contribute to the development, maintenance, drug-induced cytotoxicity and resistance of Acute Leukemia.
### Associations
    * Malignant Hematology

    * Molecular Medicine Program
### Education & Training
**Graduate:**
    * Mayo Graduate School, College of Medicine, PhD - Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics

  * ## Research Interest
The current focus of my laboratory is defining the oncogenic mechanisms of MYC in the development and maintenance of myeloid neoplasms including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelofibrosis (MF), specifically focusing on MYC-directed epigenetic regulation of DNA methyl- and hydroxy-methylation, as well as MYC-induced alarmins and their roles in chronic inflammation in both normal hematopoietic stem cells and cancer cells.
