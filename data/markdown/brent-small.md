  * ## Research Interest
Dr. Small's research focuses on changes in cognitive performance following treatment for cancer. Specifically, his research examines whether treatment for cancer conveys a risk for long-term cognitive impairment. Dr. Small is currently working on a National Cancer Institute funded study that examines the influence of genetic variation on the cognitive performance of breast cancer survivors and persons with no history of breast cancer. This project is designed to evaluate whether variations in three genes known to influence cognitive performance in non-cancer populations, Apolipoprotein E, Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor, and Catechol-O-Methytransferase, are associated with greater cognitive deficits among persons who have undergone treatment for breast cancer. Dr. Small is also a member of the Biostatistical Resource Core and specializes in the application of advanced statistical methods to longitudinal data. Finally, Dr. Small is on the faculty of the School of Aging Studies at the University of South Florida where he teaches courses on cognitive aging, research methods, and advanced statistics.
