  * ## Overview
My lab is interested in the intersection of oncogenic signaling pathways and non-coding RNAs in the initiation, progression, and resistance of cancers driven by the MAPK pathway, with an emphasis on melanoma. We study how secondary genetic events enhance or cooperate with the MAPK pathway to promote the oncogenic evolution of melanoma. Such secondary events may represent targetable vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically explored in combination with current standard-of-care targeted therapy or immunotherapy.
