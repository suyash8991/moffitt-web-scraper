  * ## Overview
Dr. Peres’ research program uses an interdisciplinary approach to elucidate contributing causes of racial and ethnic disparities in ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma.
### Associations
    * Cancer Epidemiology
    * Gynecologic Oncology
    * Cancer Epidemiology Program
### Education & Training
**Graduate:**
    * Louisiana State University, MPH - Epidemiology
    * Louisiana State University, PhD - Epidemiology
  * ## Research Interest
Dr. Peres is a cancer epidemiologist that uses an interdisciplinary approach to examine the effects of both molecular and lifestyle factors on cancer etiology and prognosis. Her research program focuses on elucidating the contributing causes of racial and ethnic disparities in ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma. She is currently characterizing epidemiologic and molecular features of these cancers in diverse populations to better understand the biologic basis of these disparities and improve outcomes.
