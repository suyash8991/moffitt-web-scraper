Hye Sook Chon, MD 
**Specialty:** Obstetrics & Gynecology 
**Program:** Gynecologic Oncology 
**Research Program:** Molecular Medicine Program 
  * ## Overview
I am interested in developing personalized care in gynecologic cancer with combination with clinic-pathologic data with genomic data.
### Associations
    * Gynecologic Oncology
    * Molecular Medicine Program
### Education & Training
**Internship:**
    * Kyung Hee University College of Medicine - Intern
**Board Certification:**
    * Obstetrics & Gynecology - Gynecologic Oncology
**Fellowship:**
    * MD Anderson International Fellow - Gynecologic Medical Oncology
    * H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research - Gynecologic Oncology
**Residency:**
    * Kyung Hee University Medical Center - Obstetrics and Gynecology
    * Baylor College of Medicine - Obstetrics and Gynecology
**Medical School:**
    * Kyung Hee University College of Medicine - MD
  * ## Research Interest
I am interested in adaptation of a genomic-wide strategy to characterize some of the molecular signaling pathways and cellular processes that are associated with known risk factor for recurrence of endometrial cancer and cervical cancer. Empiric treatment-based decision making could then be replaced with tailored therapy that matches the right patient with the right treatment plan based on her own molecular fingerprint.
