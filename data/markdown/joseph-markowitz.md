  * ## Overview
The lab’s research focuses on the role of nitric oxide in the development of melanoma and its ability to facilitate resistance to melanoma treatments such as checkpoint blockade. Additionally, we are developing tools to predict which patients are likely to fail immune-based therapy via novel high-dimensional flow cytometric, mass spectrometric, and informatic techniques, allowing those patients to be treated with other, potentially more effective, therapies.
### Associations

  * ## Research Interest
Dr. Markowitz's research interest is in studying immune suppressor cells, their role in the development of melanoma, and means of inhibiting their actions. He is a translational researcher striving to translate the knowledge gained in the laboratory via immune-based and traditional biochemical approaches to the clinic.
