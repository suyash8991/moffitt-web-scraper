Sara Tinsley Vance, PhD, APRN 
**Research Program:** Health Outcomes & Behavior Program 
  * ## Overview
My research career is centered around improving the quality of life for individuals and their families with hematologic malignancies. I am working on a National Institute of Nursing Research Institute-supported career development award (K23) to develop a quality-of-life decision-making model for older adults with acute myeloid leukemia. My next step is testing the model in a randomized controlled trial to investigate whether it improves goal-concordant care through shared decision-making. Other research includes the study of sex differences in health-related quality of life and symptoms among patients diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy.
### Associations
    * Health Outcomes & Behavior Program
### Education & Training
**Graduate:**
    * University of South Florida, PhD - Nursing
    * University of South Florida, MS - Family Nurse Practitioner
  * ## Research Interest
My research interests include health-related quality of life among patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies and how this can inform shared decision-making between the patient, their caregivers, and the healthcare team. I am analyzing data from ~ 200 patients measured over six time points during treatment to build a model for sharing with prospective patients. Other areas of research include sex-related differences in quality of life and symptoms and cancer -related cachexia and sarcopenia.
