Jeremy Goecks, PhD 
**Program:** Biostatistics and Bioinformatics 
**Research Program:** Molecular Medicine Program 
  * ## Overview
Cancer data science, Machine learning for biomedicine, Computational infrastructure for biomedicine, precision medicine, spatial and multimodal tumor biology.
### Associations
    * Biostatistics and Bioinformatics
    * Machine Learning
    * Molecular Medicine Program
  * ## Research Interest
My research interests lie at the intersection of biomedical data science, high-performance computing, and precision oncology. I have two active areas of research: Software Tools for Biomedicine: I build software tools for cancer and biomedical data science, including individual analysis packages, machine learning applications, interactive visualizations, and software platforms/infrastructure. I am a lead investigator for the Galaxy computational workbench (https://galaxyproject.org/), which is used by thousands of scientists across the world. Precision Cancer Medicine: I apply computational tools and software platforms to identify biomarkers associated with cancer susceptibility, progression, and response to therapy. Recently I have led the creation and analysis of multimodal, spatial, and single-cell molecular tumor atlases to identify tumor adaptations to therapy and potential approaches to mitigate these adaptations.
