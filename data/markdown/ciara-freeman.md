# Ciara Freeman, MD, PhD
![Ciara  Freeman](https://www.moffitt.org/globalassets/images/researchers_bio/FreemanCiara_29429.jpg)
Ciara Freeman, MD, PhD 
**Program:** Blood and Marrow Transplant and Cellular Immunotherapy 
**Research Program:** Immuno-Oncology Program 
[ Contact ](https://eforms.moffitt.org/ContactResearchersForm?PERID=29429)
  * ## Overview
Dr. Ciara Freeman is an Assistant Member in the Moffitt Cancer Center Department of Blood and Marrow Transplant and Cellular Immunotherapy. She obtained her MD from the National University of Ireland, specialised in hematology at St Bartholomew’s in London and obtained a master’s degree in Clinical Drug Development from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). She also earned her PhD in immuno-oncology and therapeutics from the Barts Cancer Institute of QMUL under Professor John Gribben. She completed a fellowship in lymphoproliferative disorders and joins us from the British Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver, Canada, where she served as Assistant Professor and the Myeloma Lead. Her clinical interests are focused on the treatment of patients with plasma cell neoplasms using autologous transplant and cellular immunotherapy. Her research interests are centred on optimising outcomes for patients using this novel approach – identifying predictors of treatment failure or toxicity, new target discovery and clinical trial development, in addition to identifying the best modalities for measuring disease burden and relapse. She is also interested in how to safely administer these highly effective and personalised cell therapies to all patients, including those with additional health concerns. Dr Freeman’s research has been acknowledged with awards from the American Society of Hematology and she is deeply motivated to translate clinical and laboratory experience to deepen our understanding so that patients can universally benefit from this novel approach to treating myeloma.
