He is also the Program Director for the Advanced Radiation Oncology Research Fellowship. Dr. Ahmed received his medical degree from the Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine in Rochester, MN and completed an internship at Baylor College of Medicine before completing his radiation oncology residency at Moffitt Cancer Center. His clinical focus is the management of patients with breast cancer. Dr. Ahmed’s primary research interest is in studying the synergism between combinations of immunologic and targeted agents with radiation therapy to improve clinical outcomes. He is the principal investigator of several multicenter clinical trials in the management of brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease with novel therapeutics and radiation therapy. He is also interested in studying personalized radiation delivery through genomic and radiomic approaches to tailor therapy to the patient. He serves on multiple journal editorial boards. Dr. Ahmed has published over 100 peer-reviewed manuscripts and has presented his research nationally and internationally.
