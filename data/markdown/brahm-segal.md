  * ## Overview
The focus of Dr. Segal’s lab is on how neutrophil and complement interactions shape the tumor microenvironment. The premise is that these innate immune responses in the non-cancer setting support wound healing following injury by dampening T cell immunity, but in the tumor microenvironment these same responses act as barriers to durable anti-tumor immunity. Our goal is to use our laboratory research as a foundation for clinical trials to evaluate novel approaches to overcome barriers to durable anti-tumor immunity

  * ## Research Interest
As an Infectious Diseases specialist, our research interest was focused on innate immune responses to infection with a focus on NADPH oxidase as a critical regulator of antimicrobial defense and inflammation. We extended our interest in innate responses to injury to the cancer microenvironment with the overall goals of understanding mechanisms that drive tumor progression and developing novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches. Using malignant fluid as an authentic component of the TME, we made novel discoveries regarding how normal neutrophils acquire a T cell suppressor phenotype in the TME. Our data support a model in which products of cellular injury and pro-inflammatory signaling cues in the TME recruit neutrophils and induce a T cell suppressor phenotype characterized by suppression of critical signaling and metabolic pathways necessary for T cell activation and proliferation. Circulating neutrophils from healthy donors or patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) were not intrinsically immunosuppressive but acquired a T-cell suppressor phenotype following exposure to OC ascites fluid supernatants. Suppressive neutrophils inhibited proliferation of primary T cells, TCR-engineered T cells, and tumor-associated lymphocytes (TALs) from patients with newly diagnosed OC. The induction of neutrophil suppressor function required complement signaling and NADPH oxidase. A similar complement-dependent neutrophil suppressor phenotype was induced by malignant effusions from other solid tumors, supporting generalizability. This body of work and the work of others in mouse models established the premise for an NCI-funded clinical trial (MPIs Emese Zsiros and Segal) involving the first use of a complement C3 inhibitor in patients with cancer. We have since made novel discoveries that support complement signaling in the tumor microenvironment as a direct T cell checkpoint that is separate from the effect of neutrophil suppressors.
