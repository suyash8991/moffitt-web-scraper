  * ## Research Interest
Hematopathologists continue to play an important role in the discovery and implementation of biomarker driven diagnosis and development of biomarker driven prognostic models. The development of molecular diagnostic strategies in patients with hematopoietic neoplasms developed as an early off shoot of studies aimed at understanding basic cellular mechanisms. As a hematopathologist, Dr. Moscinski was trained in the biology of hematologic neoplasms, the application of technology to diagnosis, and the need for high level quality assurance and clinical grade controls in development of diagnostic assays. The translation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing methodologies to the emerging molecular diagnostics field required both an understanding of patient and treating physician needs, bone marrow and lymph node histology, and basic molecular pathways and techniques, so-called “bench to bedside” translation. Her laboratory was instrumental in the development of several molecular assays used in the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with hematopoietic neoplasms. These assays were among the fore runners of modern molecular diagnostic strategies in use today. Dr. Moscinski’s recent work focuses on developing clinical grade molecular and flow cytometry based assays, in a CLIA environment, to support clinical investigators and clinical treatment trials for patients with hematologic malignancies. As department Chair and Director of the clinical laboratories (including molecular diagnostics), her responsibilities include assuring the coordination and smooth translation of new biomarker studies into clinical research and guiding a team of hematopathologists in the implementation and development of new strategies.
