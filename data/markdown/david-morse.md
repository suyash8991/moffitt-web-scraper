David Morse, PhD 
**Program:** Metabolism and Physiology 
**Research Program:** Molecular Medicine Program 
[ Contact ](https://eforms.moffitt.org/ContactResearchersForm?PERID=4682)
  * ## Overview
My research themes include: cell-surface target discovery, development of cell-surface target binding moieties, development of cell-surface targeted conjugates for delivery of imaging contrast and/or therapy. Recent work has focused on the development of targeted alpha-particle therapies with companion imaging tracers, and fluorescence molecular imaging and imaging tracer conjugates for surgical guidance. The goal is translation of these novel radiopharmaceuticals and fluorescence molecular imaging conjugates for clinical testing.

Dr. Morse’s current research projects are focused on development of targeted alpha-particle radiopharmaceutical therapies (TAT-RPTs) for rare melanomas, including acral, uveal, and mucosal melanomas, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and metastatic breast cancer; development of companion imaging tracers for the TAT-RPTs for personalized image-guided three-dimensional radiation dosimetry and following therapy response; development of a bispecific nanobody fluorescence and SPECT imaging conjugate for surgical guidance in breast cancer axillary lymph node surgery; and studying the radiobiology of targeted alpha-particle therapies.
