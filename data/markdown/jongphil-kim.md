  * ## Overview
I have sought to develop statistical methodologies to solve statistical problems identified through collaborative research. My primary research interest involves the design and analysis of early phase clinical trials, multiple comparisons, time-to-event endpoints analysis, imaging data analysis, concordance, and longitudinal data analysis.
### Associations
    * Biostatistics and Bioinformatics
    * Blood and Marrow Transplant and Cellular Immunotherapy
    * Immuno-Oncology Program
    * Experimental Therapeutics Program
    * Melanoma & Skin Cancer Center of Excellence
### Education & Training
**Graduate:**
    * Pusan National University, MS - Mechanical Engineering
    * Georgia Institute of Technology, MS - Industrial Engineering
    * Georgia Institute of Technology, MS - Statistics
    * Georgia Institute of Technology, PhD - Industrial & Systems Engineering with Applied Statistics
  * ## Research Interest
My primary research interest in the biostatistics area involves the design and analysis of early phase clinical trials, multiple comparisons, time-to-event endpoints analysis, imaging data analysis, concordance, and longitudinal data analysis. As a collaborative track faculty member, my collaborative research interests are diverse. I have actively collaborated with investigators affiliated with the Blood and Marrow Transplant and Cellular Immunotherapy (BMT-CI), Malignant Hematology, Imaging, Radiology, Radiation Oncology, Health Outcomes & Behavior (HOB), Cancer Epidemiology (CE), Geriatric, GI, Thoracic, and Basic Science programs. My role includes the development of LOIs/IITs, the development of extramural/intramural grants applications, the design and analysis of the early phase clinical trials, and the analysis of retrospective studies. Furthermore, I have enthusiastically developed novel methods and applied state-of-the-art approaches in practice. For instance, I developed the Modified Simon’s design with Dr. Michael Schell for the design of single-arm phase II IITs.
