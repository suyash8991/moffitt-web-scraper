  * ## Research Interest
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. Among several treatment options, the primary treatment option for initial therapy for localized prostate cancer is radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Among prostate cancer patients who had these treatments, approximately 30% will have recurrence. Currently, the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA), cancer stage (TNM system) and the grade of tumor (Gleason score) are used to estimate prognosis and inform treatment modalities. Although these measurements are extremely useful, additional biomarkers are needed to better predict the outcome of prostate cancer. Dr. Park and his laboratory team are interested in genetic and epigenetic variations associated with prostate cancer recurrence. In addition, Dr. Park is also interested in health disparity on risk for prostate cancer, among African American men.
