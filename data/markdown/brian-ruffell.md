  * ## Research Interest
Effectively harnessing the power of the immune system is one of the most promising advances in cancer therapy. Immune-based therapies take advantage of the tumor killing capacity of cytotoxic T cells, an ability that is normally limited within tumors via multiple suppressive pathways. Supporting the activity of these cytotoxic T cells can provide long-term survival advantages, but despite recent successes, only a fraction of patients respond to immunotherapy, and efficacious treatment has so far been largely limited to select tumor types. The identification of additional therapeutic targets is urgently needed to address these issues and expand upon the number of patients who will benefit from this relatively safe and effective treatment approach. The Ruffell Lab is focused on understanding the role of key myeloid subsets within hormone-drive malignancies in order to identify and develop novel therapeutic targets and approaches.
