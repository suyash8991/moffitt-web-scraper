  * ## Overview
Dr. Chung's laboratory has been working on molecular characterization of head and neck cancer (HNC) and translation of these findings to develop integral biomarker-driven clinical trials. Using multi-omics approach, our research has shown that tumors sharing the same histology have distinct molecular gene and protein expression profiles, and these molecularly defined patient populations have distinctly different clinical outcomes. We are evaluating the tumor immune microenvironment of tobacco-related and human papillomavirus-related HNC to identify novel molecular processes which can be therapeutically exploited.
