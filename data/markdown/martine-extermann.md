  * ## Research Interest
Dr. Extermann’s work seeks to understand how general health of the older patient interacts with cancer behavior, and conduct and outcomes of their cancer treatment. She works on designing models that intertwine geriatric assessment and oncology decision tools. She has designed a model for estimating the benefit from adjuvant therapy in older breast cancer patients, adjusting for comorbidity. She has also devised an index that allows assessing the individual risk of severe toxicity from chemotherapy: the Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-age patients (CRASH) score. She is conducting studies to explore the interaction of comorbidity with cancer behavior and treatment.
