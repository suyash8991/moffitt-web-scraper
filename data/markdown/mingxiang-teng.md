  * ## Overview
Dr. Teng’s research focuses on data science questions in decoding cancer epigenomic mechanisms. Epigenomics complement genomics studies in understanding cancer oncogenesis and provide new insights in cancer treatment. His data science researches, in conjunction with wet-lab collaborations, generate novel approaches to process, integrate and interpret epigenomic data toward cancer discovery.
