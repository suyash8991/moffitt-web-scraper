[ Contact ](https://eforms.moffitt.org/ContactResearchersForm?PERID=33318)
  * ## Overview
Dr. Xie's primary research focuses on Hematologic Malignancies, particularly myeloid malignancy and Clonal hematopoiesis. She possesses extensive expertise in clinical research and clinical trials. She is a lead clinical investigator in the clonal hematopoiesis clinic at Moffitt Cancer Center. Her clinical research contributions extend to the design and implementation of clinical trials targeting novel therapies for myeloid neoplasms. In addition to research, she is dedicated to enhancing patient care through the development of precision medicine-based clinical trials.
### Associations
    * Malignant Hematology
    * Molecular Medicine Program
  * ## Research Interest
I am interested in Clonal Hematopoiesis (CH) research- As the lead clinical investigator for the CH clinic at MCC., I am interested in studying the risk of CH progression to myeloid malignancy. I developed the Clonal Cytopenia Risk Score, which was published in the Blood Journal. Further, I designed the NCI-sponsored phase II clinical trial NCT03418038, "Using Ascorbic Acid (AA) in Patients with TET2-mutated clonal cytopenia", one of the first clinical trials in the CH space. This project has been recognized with an ASH CRTI award. I am currently working with other collaborators to evaluate clonal evolution and design other novel clinical trials for preventing CH progression and improving the outcome of patients with CH. I have co-authored over 50 peer-reviewed publications, 14 of which I am the first author. My work has earned me multiple accolades, including the ASH CRTI award, the ASH Abstract Achievement Award, the Outstanding Hematology-Oncology Fellow Award from the Minnesota Society of Clinical Oncology, and the Robert A Winn Career Development Award.
