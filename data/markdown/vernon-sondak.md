[ Contact ](https://eforms.moffitt.org/ContactResearchersForm?PERID=2995)
  * ## Overview
New treatments for adults and children with melanoma and other cutaneous malignancies, with particular emphasis on preoperative (neoadjuvant) therapy approaches and on the prediction of nodal metastasis in clinically localized melanoma.

    * Immuno-Oncology Program
    * Melanoma & Skin Cancer Center of Excellence
### Education & Training
**Internship:**
    * UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA - Resident - General Surgery

  * ## Research Interest
Dr. Sondak has been a leader in studies of surgical treatment of melanoma and other cutaneous malignancies, particularly the application of sentinel lymph node biopsy and lymph node dissection to the staging and treatment of melanoma, and has been instrumental in mentoring and training many surgeons in these techniques over the years. His research interests include surgical treatment of melanoma in adults and children; adjuvant (postoperative) and neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy of melanoma; and evaluation of new therapies for localized or disseminated melanoma.
