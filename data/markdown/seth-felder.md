Seth Felder, MD 
**Program:** Gastrointestinal Oncology 
**Research Program:** Cancer Epidemiology Program 
  * ## Overview
To improve the understanding of rectal cancer patients who achieve a complete clinical response after receiving neoadjuvant treatment and are then able to undergo a non-operative “watch-and-wait” observation strategy.
### Associations
    * Gastrointestinal Oncology
    * Cancer Epidemiology Program
### Education & Training
**Board Certification:**
**Fellowship:**
    * University of Minnesota - Colon and Rectal Surgery
    * Memorial Sloan Kettering - Advanced Colorectal Surgical Oncology
**Residency:**
    * Cedars-Sinai Medical Center - General Surgery
**Medical School:**
    * University of South Florida - MD
  * ## Research Interest
The paradigm of rectal cancer treatment has drastically changed over the past decade. Now, almost 1/3rd to 1/2 may defer or avoid radical rectal resection following neoadjuvant treatment. The ability to predict a complete response (tumor biology), as well as select accurately a patient that has obtained a complete response (imaging, endoscopy, tumor markers) remains suboptimal. Better tools to predict, personalize treatment to maximize organ preservation, and accurately select patients is the future of rectal cancer treatment
