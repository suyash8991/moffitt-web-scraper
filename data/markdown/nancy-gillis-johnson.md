  * ## Research Interest
Dr. Gillis is a molecular epidemiologist with a background in pharmacogenomics and precision medicine. Her research focuses on the use of genetic biomarkers to predict risk, adverse events, and outcomes in the setting of cancer, with an emphasis on myeloid pre-leukemic conditions, such as clonal hematopoiesis (CH or CHIP), clonal cytopenias (CCUS), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Her translational research program aims to inform interventions and management strategies that can be implemented in clinical settings to improve outcomes for patients affected by these conditions.
