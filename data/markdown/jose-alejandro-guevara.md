  * ## Overview
Dr. Guevara-Patiño’s research is focused on identifying signaling cues that can be exploited for the benefit of cancer patients receiving T cell-based immunotherapy, by deeply understanding the immune fertile conditions that are necessary to generate robust anti-tumor T cell responses. José Alejandro is specifically interested in understanding the role of RPS6 as well as the effects of tumor-related hypoxia on anti-tumor T cells. In addition, he is implementing machine learning approaches for the development of immunological predictive biomarkers that will permit the stratification of cancer patients receiving immunotherapies.
