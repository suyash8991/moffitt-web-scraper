  * ## Overview
Dr. Gonzalez's research aims to improve quality of life in cancer survivors and reduce disparities in cancer survivorship issues among underserved populations.
### Associations
    * Genitourinary Oncology
    * Health Outcomes and Behavior
    * Health Outcomes & Behavior Program
### Education & Training
**Graduate:**
    * University of South Florida, MA - Clinical Psychology
    * University of South Florida, PhD - Clinical Psychology

  * ## Research Interest
Dr. Gonzalez obtained his PhD in Clinical Psychology at the University of South Florida and completed a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Behavioral Oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center. His research focuses on improving cancer survivorship. He aims to develop biopsychosocial models to predict quality of life issues in cancer populations. These models account for the unique contribution of cancer and treatment for cancer. Dr. Gonzalez also develops mobile health (mHealth) behavioral interventions to address quality of life issues among cancer populations. Dr. Gonzalez’s work also aims to reduce disparities in cancer survivorship.
