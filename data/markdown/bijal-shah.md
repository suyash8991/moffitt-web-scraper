**Program:** Malignant Hematology 
**Research Program:** Immuno-Oncology Program 
[ Contact ](https://eforms.moffitt.org/ContactResearchersForm?PERID=8329)
  * ## Overview
Dr. Shah is focused on clinical and translational research efforts, particularly in regards to mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with a specific interest in issues related to the care of adolescents and young adults. His interests in the latter are a direct extension of my background in pediatrics, and have been supplemented by work done at Moffitt, as well as within the cooperative group setting.
### Associations
    * Malignant Hematology
    * Immuno-Oncology Program
### Education & Training
**Graduate:**
    * University of South Florida, MS - Clinical & Translational Research
**Board Certification:**
    * Internal Medicine - Hematology
**Fellowship:**
    * Moffitt Cancer Center - Hematology & Oncology
**Residency:**
    * Duke University - Internal Medicine & Pediatrics
**Medical School:**

  * ## Research Interest
Dr. Shah has served as primary investigator on 11 phase 1, 2, and 3 studies, with a special focus on investigational therapeutics for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). He has also worked to create our institutional database for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), given our high volumes in this regard. At present Moffitt has over 350 patients characterized, from which we have already generated several abstracts to further our understanding of this disease.
