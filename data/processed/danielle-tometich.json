    "Danielle Tometich, PhD is a clinical health psychologist specializing in behavioral oncology. She earned a PhD in clinical psychology from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and completed a clinical internship at Yale University. She completed the NCI-funded Behavioral Oncology Training Program (T32) at Moffitt Cancer Center and is now a K99 post-doctoral fellow. The goal of Dr. Tometich\u2019s research is to improve quality of life for cancer survivors and those living with metastatic disease. In pursuit of this goal, she uses quantitative and qualitative approaches to understand cancer-related cognitive impairment, describe symptoms, identify targets for health behavior change, and elucidate patient-reported outcomes of novel therapies for metastatic cancer.\n  *"
