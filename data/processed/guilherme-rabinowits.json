  "overview": "I am a medical oncologist focused on head and neck, endocrine and non-melanoma skin cancers. I have experience in clinical and translational research, identifying new therapeutic agents for those tumors, based on their molecular biology. In collaboration with other medical, surgical and radiation oncologists, and lab scientists, we prospectively collect tumor tissues over the years to identify actionable target mutations and tested innovative treatments in both pre-clinical and clinical settings.",
  "research_interests": [
    "I am interested in clinical and translational research to identify new predictive and prognostic biomarkers in head and neck, endocrine and non-melanoma skin cancers. I am also interested in early detection and prevention, and identification of new therapies that would optimize the outcome of my patients.\n  *"
