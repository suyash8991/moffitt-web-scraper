    "My research investigates how protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes interact to affect the cell cycle during cancer growth and development. Information on the role of PKC isozymes in cell cycle regulation is important since PKC overproduction has been linked with the rapid growth rate of cancer cells. Our studies use human cancer cells in-vitro to determine how PKC inhibitors alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics affect PKC, cell proliferation and survival. The goals are to identify PKC isozymes or PKC substrates which regulate the cell cycle in order to target and interfere with their activity, thereby providing selective therapeutic agents for controlling cancer cell proliferation. Our research methods employ physical and biochemical isolation procedures, glioma PKC overexpressors, flow cytometry, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and Western blotting.\n  *"
