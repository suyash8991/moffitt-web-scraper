  "overview": "Dr Forsyth has a strong interest in malignant, invasive glioma brain tumors and leptomeningeal disease. He is currently investigating several inhibiting agents in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. His laboratory interests are in gliomas and melanoma brain metastases. He works using oncolytic viruses as immunotherapies, neurotrophins, and their receptors in melanoma and other brain metastasis.",

    "Dr. Forsyth has a strong interest in malignant, invasive glioma brain tumors. He is currently investigating several tumor-inhibiting agents in Phase I clinical trials. One of his first priorities at Moffitt is to develop a neural tumor stem cell lab to expand research opportunities in novel therapeutic cancer-fighting drugs. Currently, he has 10 active grants funding his studies.\n  *"
