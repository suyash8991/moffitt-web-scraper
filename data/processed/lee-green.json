    "Dr. Green\u2019s research focuses on cancer health disparities, particularly in education, knowledge and awareness among minority populations with strong interest in community-based participatory research and minority participation in clinical trials and research studies. He has completed extensive work in the area of minority participation in clinical trials and research studies. Dr. Green is currently serving as the Co-Principal Investigator of the USF/Moffitt Health Disparities Center. This grant is designed to help build infrastructure with-in institutions to better equip them to address health disparities. He is also a co-investigator on an NIH grant examining the influence of the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study on willingness to participate in biomedical studies. The research has involved the development of a survey tool to assess participation into clinical trials and research studies and is one of the first studies to quantitatively assess the impact of the Syphilis Study on minority participation in clinical trials.\n  *"
