    "Dr. Permuth is a molecular epidemiologist whose research focuses on investigating the molecular basis of gastrointestinal malignancies. Her research portfolio is currently dedicated to three key areas: 1) developing early detection and prevention strategies for pancreatic cancer; 2) understanding and targeting biological reasons for the higher pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates observed among African Americans; and 3) studying inherited and acquired markers of cancer susceptibility, prognosis, and response to therapy. She is also a founding principal investigator of a multi-institutional partnership known as the Florida Pancreas Collaborative which aims to advance pancreatic cancer research in the state of Florida and beyond. Her team\u2019s overarching goal is to develop and implement strategies to personalize care and improve outcomes for populations affected by or at risk for GI malignancies. In her leadership role as the first Vice Chair of Research in the Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, she works with faculty, staff, and other stakeholders to develop, maintain, and lead active translational research programs in GI Oncology.\n  *"
