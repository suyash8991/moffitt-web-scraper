    "Dr. Dunne\u2019s primary research interest is the development of technologies that improve the delivery efficiency of a wide range of therapeutics to solid tumors. Specifically, the Dune Lab focuses on using novel hydrogel materials in order to develop triggered-release, cell-based drug delivery therapeutics that modulate the tumor microenvironment in order to improve the efficacy of the current generation of cell and immuno-therapies. Additional research is focused on improving anti-cancer cell therapies by combining them with externally applied stimuli (e.g. radiotherapy, hyperthermia, and/or focused ultrasound) in order to alter immune cell accumulation and distribution within the tumor.\n  *"
