  "overview": "Dr. Yamoah is a board-certified radiation oncologist and physician scientist with expertise in cancer health disparities spanning clinical care, and translational research. He directs a global laboratory that focuses on the identification of clinically relevant environmental and biological contributions to aggressive disease and poor survival in men of African origin with prostate cancer and has established international research partnerships with academic centers in Africa to study prostate cancer.",
  "research_interests": [
    "Dr. Yamoah\u2019s research utilizes a multidisciplinary approach that combines methods from epidemiology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, pathology, molecular biology, and genomic studies. His laboratory research focuses on developing novel approaches to better predict aggressive disease and appropriately treat men of African descent with prostate cancer. Recently, work done in his lab show that prostate tumors from African-American men have a immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment characterized by low DNA damage repair and high IFN-response pathways. This body of work will promote a genomic-adaptive approach to treating prostate cancer in African-American men \u2013 a step towards personalized medicine.\n  *"
