  "overview": "As an applied medical anthropologist, I bring cross-cultural perspectives to the study of cancer health disparities as well as extensive experience in qualitative, ethnographic, and mixed methods research. My program of research has consistently focused on understanding the influence of socio-cultural factors on health and to develop and identify the best models and methods for adapting instrumentation and proven interventions to address health disparities across the cancer continuum.",

    "She has worked to develop and culturally adapt evidence-based interventions to address the psychosocial and information needs of Hispanic patients. For example, she led an exploratory sequential mixed method study, which employed a series of iterative and group consensus-building approaches, to translate and culturally adapt the previously validated CaSUN measure into Spanish, for Latino cancer survivors. In addition, she also worked to culturally adapt and evaluate a patient self-administered stress-management training intervention for Hispanic/Latina breast cancer patients and education tools to promote cancer screening. She also has extensive experience in program evaluation and has conducted process and outcome evaluation for several National Cancer Institute and CDC funded health disparities initiatives, including the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network, Cancer, and Culture and Literacy Training Institute and Florida Prevention Research Center. She is bilingual in English and Spanish and has worked closely with various community-based organizations to address health disparities among ethnic minorities and underserved populations in the United States as well as Latin America (e.g., Puerto Rico, Ecuador, Panama). Her community experience has also provided her with invaluable insights about partnership and coalition building processes. Dr. Martinez Tyson is also a volunteer with Latinos Unidos por Un Nuevo Amanecer, Inc. a non-profit organization that provides support to Latinos diagnosed with cancer and Campamento Alegria, a 3-Day integrative program for Latina cancer survivors. She is currently working with faculty across COPH on the Salud Latina Initiative to address Latino health disparities.
