    "Dr. John Cleveland was trained at the National Cancer Institute under the direction of Dr. Ulf R. Rapp (who discovered Raf family oncogenes) and began his career as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biochemistry of St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in 1989. He became a Full Professor in 2000 and was also Program Leader of the Signal Transduction Program. In November of 2006 he was recruited to become founding Chair of the Department of Cancer Biology at The Scripps Research Institute. He joined the Moffitt Cancer Center on July 1 as Associate Center Director of Basic Science, where he holds the Cortner Couch Endowed Chair and the academic appointment of Senior Member and Professor in the Department of Tumor Biology. Dr. Cleveland\u2019s research has been broadly focused on the molecular pathogenesis of cancer, where he has been a leader in interrogating the regulation and role of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in controlling cancer cell growth and survival, and in defining new targets that play essential roles in the development and maintenance of cancer. In line with the mission of Moffitt, all his lab\u2019s is dedicated towards developing new agents and strategies for the prevention and treatment of cancer. Dr. Cleveland has been continuously funded through NIH R01 grants since 1991. Dr. Cleveland has been and continues to be an invited lecturer at many Institutes and at several national and international scientific meetings. Over the years, Dr. Cleveland has supervised more than 35 postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, and over 24 of these have gone on to establish independent and successful careers in academia, or in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry sectors. Dr. Cleveland has published over 150 peer-reviewed articles and 40 book chapters and review articles in the cancer research field. Several of these have been published in top-tier scientific journals, including Cell, Molecular Cell, Cancer Cell, Nature, Nature Medicine, Genes & Development, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, The EMBO Journal, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Cancer Research and the Journal of Experimental Medicine. Dr. Cleveland has been a long standing Member of the American Association of Sciences, the American Society of Microbiology and of the American Association of Cancer Research. Dr. Cleveland has also served as an Editor for several prestigious journals, including Molecular Biology of the Cell and Molecular and Cellular Biology, and as an Associate Editor for Cell Death and Differentiation and for Cancer Research. He also has a long history as a Reviewer for Study Sections, for both the American Cancer Society (six years) and for the National Institutes of Health (NIH, for ~20 years); including as Chair of the Parent Committee (NCI-C) that reviews Program Project Grants for the National Cancer Institute. Finally, he has also served as a Member of the Extramural Scientific Advisory Boards for The University of Arizona (for their SPORE and PPG programs), The Roswell Park Cancer Institute, The Blood Research Institute, and for the Florida Center for Brain Tumor Research at the University of Florida. At Moffitt he co-chairs the Core Leadership Committee, and serves on the Research Executive Committee, the Research Institute Steering Committee and the Scientific Leadership Committee.\n  *"
