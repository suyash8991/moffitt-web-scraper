  "overview": "To date, Dr. Shain has been actively participating in translation research in multiple myeloma and other hematologic malignancies, with 40 publications as well as a number of book chapters. Clinically, Dr. Shain is/has been the principal investigator and co-investigator of a number of clinical trials in multiple myeloma. His translational research has focused on the mechanisms by which components of the bone marrow microenvironment influence myeloma biology, survival, and drug response. He is currently collaborating with a wide range of Moffitt and non-Moffitt researchers, mathematicians, clinicians and other groups to carry out his research goals.",
  "research_interests": [
    "This research goal and desire to bring personalized therapy to the forefront of myeloma therapy involves several projects \u2013 (1) Personalized care of multiple myeloma: A) EMMA (evolutionary mathematical myeloma advisor) - a novel collaboration with critical alliance with our integrated mathematical oncology department (Dr. Robert Gatenby, Dr. Robert Gilles and Dr. Ariosto Silva among others) characterizing aspects of the evolution of drug response. This collaboration has led the development of a novel mathematically-based model to predict patient response to therapy; thus, facilitating potential for the design of patient-specific/optimized therapeutic strategies that could extend survival in patients. B) GEP (gene expression profiling) - under a sponsored research agreement with Signal Genetics we will develop GEP signatures to better define risk of progression for antecedent conditions and to better inform key patient management decisions in multiple myeloma. (2) Targeting mediators of plasma cell development: Using three different mouse models we have identified a heretofore uncharacterized role of the histone deacetylase (HDAC), HDAC11, in plasma cell differentiation and biology. Our preliminary data indicate that HDAC11, the most recently identified HDAC, is critical for B cell development, more specifically plasma cell differentiation in vivo. Ongoing research will hopefully lead to the development of targeted therapeutics and clinical trials in myeloma patients. (3) Microenvironment-modulated synthetic lethality: Microenvironmental determinants alter tumor drug response; thereby, conferring myeloma survival and drug resistance. To this end, major questions remain: A) Can we identify key environmental determinants facilitating this survival phenotype to combat EMDR, MRD (minimal residual disease), and relapse? B) Can we identify drug targets that exhibit a TME-induced \u201csynthetic lethality\u201d (e.g. drugs with increased activity within the context of the TME)? We have recently identified PYK2/FAK2 as a target meeting this criteria and are working on translating this into clinical trials in collaboration with Verastem.\n  *"
