  "overview": "Dr. Strosberg's research is focused on development of new treatments for neuroendocrine cancers. He led the phase III NETTER-1 trial resulting in approval of the first peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in oncology and has helped to develop new trials currently testing targeted alpha therapies. He has also been instrumental in studying novel chemotherapy regimens, such as capecitabine/temozolomide for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and has conducted extensive clinical research on the role of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Current work involves development of cell-based therapies including CAR-T and BiTE treatments for somatostatin receptor expressing NETs.",
  "research_interests": [
    "Dr. Strosberg has been a leader in the field of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. He led the NETTER-1 trial (Strosberg et al. NEJM 2017) which was the first phase III trial of a radiolabeled somatostatin analog. He is currently conducting trials investigating new alpha emitting radionuclides including 212Pb-DOTAMTATE (Strosberg et al. ASCO 2024) and 225Ac-DOTATATE (Strosberg et al. ESMO 2023). He has led multiple studies evaluating checkpoint inhibitor therapy for NETs including pembrolizumab, pembrolizumab/lenvatinib and ipilimumab/nivolumab, and has been a leading investigator in multiple studies of targeted agents. He evaluation of capecitabine/temozolomide in pancreatic NETs led to a positive randomized prospective study validating the important role of this regimen for progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. In preclinical research, he holds several patents including a CAR-T cell targeting somatostatin receptor and a bispecific T cell (BiTE) targeting the same receptor. \n  *"
