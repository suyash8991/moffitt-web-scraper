    "Dr. Sallman\u2019s research interests focus on the development of novel, targeted therapeutic strategies (i.e. Phase I and II clinical trials) for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on the underlying mutational drivers of each disease. Dr. Sallman studies the genetic drivers of myeloid diseases in order to improve prognostication for patients and also to allow for more personalized treatment. He has published significantly on this topic including recently in highly regarded journals including Leukemia and Haematologica and these work form the foundation of the clinical trials that he is bringing to patients in order to improve their quality of life and survival. As an example, Dr. Sallman has focused research and clinical trial efforts on patients who have TP53 mutation (often associated with complex genes/cytogenetics) given their high risk of transformation to acute leukemia and poor survival.\n  *"
