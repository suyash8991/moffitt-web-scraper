    "Anna R. Giuliano, PhD, is the founding director of the Center for Immunization and Infection Research in Cancer (CIIRC) at the Moffitt Cancer Center. Her career had its inception in the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and cervical cancer, and it has evolved over the past several decades to encompass HPV and penile, anal, and oral cancers in men, as well as other infectious diseases and their causal relationships with various cancers. Dr. Giuliano\u2019s work has contributed significantly to the elucidation of the rate at which HPV infections are acquired and persist, the proportion of infections that progress to disease, and HPV vaccine protection against multiple diseases in women and men. An expert in the field of cancer research with a longstanding and successful record of National Institutes of Health funding since 1990, she has led numerous cancer epidemiology and prevention studies and clinical trials conducted among diverse populations in the United States and internationally. Dr. Giuliano\u2019s current research encompasses the following: the study of oral HPV natural history, efficacy of HPV vaccination for the prevention of oropharyngeal cancer among people living with HIV and among people without HIV, development of a biomarker panel for the early detection of oropharyngeal cancer, efficacy testing of therapeutic vaccines to treat HPV-related pre-cancers and cancers, the study of the immune response of cancer patients to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, methods to increasing screening for hepatitis C infection and connection to care, and the global elimination of HPV-related cancers. Dr. Giuliano has authored more than 425 peer-reviewed publications. \n  *"
