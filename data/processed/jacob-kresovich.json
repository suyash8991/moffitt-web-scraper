  "overview": "Jacob K. Kresovich, PhD, MPH is a molecular cancer epidemiologist focused on identifying the biological processes that link aging and immune function to breast cancer development and survival.",
  "research_interests": [
    "Dr. Kresovich\u2019s research is focused on characterizing molecular and immunological changes that occur before, during and after cancer development and treatment. Dr. Kresovich earned a PhD in Epidemiology from the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health and an MPH in Epidemiology from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. He completed a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Epidemiology Branch of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, where his work focused on investigating the relationship between blood DNA methylation profiles and aging, environmental exposures, lifestyles, behaviors, and breast cancer risk. Since joining Moffitt, Dr. Kresovich has extended his research to include studies of how breast cancer treatments affects aging rates and cardiovascular disease risk. \n  *"
