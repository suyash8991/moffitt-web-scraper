  "overview": "My research interest is in the conduct of investigational clinical trials in urothelial cancer and translational research to identify potential biomarkers to inform therapeutic efficacy. My current research builds upon my past achievements and aims to identify clinically actionable biomarkers to predict treatment response as well as to leverage the insights generated to design more innovative and efficacious therapies.",
  "research_interests": [
    "To achieve this, I am leveraging samples collected from several clinical trials I led employing novel therapeutic strategies in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer, BCG unresponsive CIS-containing NMIBC, as well as intermediate risk NMIBC.\n  *"
