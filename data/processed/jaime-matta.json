    "My main research expertise is in the area of toxicology. Over the years, I have worked in three main areas within that large interdisciplinary field of toxicology. During the last seven years, I have been primarily focused in the field of clinical cancer research studying the role of DNA repair as a risk factor for skin and breast cancer. The overall goals of my laboratory are to: a) define the role of DNA repair in skin and breast cancer susceptibility and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents b) to identify DNA repair genes that are associated with significant changes in risk to skin and breast cancer, c) study mechanisms involved in the regulation of DNA repair gene expression by activated Stat3 signaling in melanoma skin cancer, d) determine how genetic and environmental factors influence the risk of skin and breast cancer at the populational level.\n  *"
