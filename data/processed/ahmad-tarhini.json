  "overview": "As a clinical and translational physician-scientist, a major objective of Dr Tarhini's research has been the pursuit of studies that test novel targeted therapeutic strategies selected on the basis of a continuously deepening understanding of the molecular circuitry and immune biology of melanoma. This is in addition to a research focus upon the testing of predictors of response to immunotherapeutic agents and prognostic biomarkers of disease outcome. He has also been interested in health economics and outcomes research. He achieved independence early on in his career through novel investigator-initiated clinical and translational studies, leadership of national US Cooperative Group studies and NIH-funded translational projects that he heavily invested within the University of Pittsburgh's Skin Spore Grant where he has served for 10 years as Project Co-leader of the Biomarker Skin Spore Project. He also served as the principal investigator of the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) grant at Case Comprehensive Cancer Center. His original work on immunotherapy of melanoma and biomarkers of disease prognosis and therapeutic benefit has been published in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals and presented at leading national/international meetings. He currently serves as a chair/co-chair on several cooperative group trials, including U.S. Intergroup clinical trials E1609, S1404, EA6141, E3612, E3611, NCI8628, NCI10061 and EA6194. His efforts were awarded by being presented the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Junior Scholar Award in Clinical Research, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Research and Education Foundation Young Investigator Award and the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute Top Publication Award. Board certified in medical oncology, Dr. Tarhini\u2019s clinical interests include melanoma (cutaneous, uveal and mucosal) and other skin cancers. He served as a Track Leader of ASCO's Cancer Education Committee Melanoma/Skin Cancers Track and a member of the Scientific Committee. He served as an Organizer of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) annual meeting. Dr Tarhini also serves as Chair, Scientific Committee, Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) and Chair, ORIEN ImmunoOncology Research Subcommittee. Moffitt Cancer Center",
