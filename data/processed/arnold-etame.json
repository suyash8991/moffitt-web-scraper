    "Dr. Etame's research program focuses on elucidating and targeting mechanisms that drive therapeutic resistance in glioblastoma using state of the art innovative strategies. In particular, there is a significant emphasis on translational targeting of malignant reprogramming mechanisms in glioblastoma stem cells. These research efforts are currently federally funded through a combination of NIH R21s and R01 grants. Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal malignant brain cancer with limited therapeutic options and a dismal survival. Glioblastoma stem cells represent a small subset of the tumor population that is highly resistant to therapy, thereby serving as a reservoir for tumor recurrence and lethality. Hence, developing therapies that effectively target glioblastoma stem cells could have a positive impact on glioblastoma outcomes. To this end, we have examined at the genetic and epigenetic scale, various malignant reprogramming mechanisms associated with glioblastoma stem adaptation to therapy. Translating these findings into early-stage window-of-opportunity clinical trials is of utmost interest. \n  *"
