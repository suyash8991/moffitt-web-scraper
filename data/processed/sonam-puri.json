  "overview": "My clinical and research interest within thoracic oncology include clinical and translational research in small cell and EGFR mutation positive lung cancer.",
  "research_interests": [
    "My research interests include 1. Designing and conducting clinical trials for novel targeted therapies and immunotherapies in lung cancer. Over the past five years, I have advanced my expertise as a clinical investigator in lung cancer, playing key roles in multiple clinical studies. A notable experience was my critical role in the \"Osi + Ipi study,\" a phase 1 trial of Osimertinib and ipilimumab in EGFR-mutated NSCLC I was instrumental in-patient recruitment, regulatory coordination, and data analysis, leading to the successful completion of study accrual in February 2024. Building on this, I spearheaded an investigator-initiated phase 1 study integrating tumor-treating fields into therapy for locally advanced/stage III NSCLC. As the principal investigator at the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI), I led the project from protocol development to securing FDA IDE approval, with the trial activating in March 2024. I am now extending this work at MCC, continuing as the site PI while collaborating with translational and basic science teams to advance our understanding of lung cancer biology. 2. Engaging with biotechnology partners to explore new technologies to deepen our understanding of disease progression and improve prognostic accuracy in patients with lung cancer eg of research in this area include CNSide for CSF-derived tumor cells and FitBit\u00ae for prognosis assessment. 3. Improving our understanding of molecular Subtyping and innovative therapeutics for Small Cell Lung Cancer In addition to my work in NSCLC, I have a strong interest in SCLC. I have led multi-institutional collaborations with Dr. Owonikoko (University of Maryland), Dr. Oliver (Duke University), and Dr. Liu (Georgetown University), focusing on the molecular subtyping of high-grade neuroendocrine malignancies, including both lung and extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma. I have presented the data from these collaborations at prominent national and international meetings, including ASCO 2021 and ESMO 2022. These presentations were well-received, and publications based on this work are forthcoming, where I will serve as the first author. Furthermore, I have served as the site PI for three SCLC studies, including a trial with tarlatamab that recently received FDA approval for recurrent SCLC. This achievement underscores my ongoing commitment to advancing therapies for this challenging disease and highlights my proactive approach to driving innovation in lung cancer treatment.\n  *"
