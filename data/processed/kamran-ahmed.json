  "overview": "Dr. Kamran Ahmed is an Associate Member with Tenure in the Department of Radiation Oncology and Department of Immunology at Moffitt Cancer Center and an Associate Professor in the Department of Oncologic Sciences at the University of South Florida. He is the Vice Chair for Clinical Research in the Department of Radiation Oncology and the Section Chief for the Breast Radiotherapy Service at Moffitt Cancer Center. He is also the Program Director for the Advanced Radiation Oncology Research Fellowship. Dr. Ahmed received his medical degree from the Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine in Rochester, MN and completed an internship at Baylor College of Medicine before completing his radiation oncology residency at Moffitt Cancer Center. His clinical focus is the management of patients with breast cancer. Dr. Ahmed\u2019s primary research interest is in studying the synergism between combinations of immunologic and targeted agents with radiation therapy to improve clinical outcomes. He is the principal investigator of several multicenter clinical trials in the management of brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease with novel therapeutics and radiation therapy. He is also interested in studying personalized radiation delivery through genomic and radiomic approaches to tailor therapy to the patient. He serves on multiple journal editorial boards. Dr. Ahmed has published over 100 peer-reviewed manuscripts and has presented his research nationally and internationally.",
