  "overview": "Dr. Duckett has a wealth of experience in identifying tractable anti-cancer targets, developing selective small molecule probes of these targets, and in optimizing these leads to generate safety assessment candidates for testing in preclinical tumor models and, ultimately in moving these agents forward into the clinic. Derek is PI of 4 R01 grants and has several ongoing kinase inhibitor programs that are targeting: (i) CK1\u03b4 and CK1\u03b5 that regulate WNT-\u03b2-catenin signaling and DNA repair pathways in metastatic triple negative breast cancer and glioblastoma, respectively; (ii) the transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinases CDK12 and CDK13 in trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ breast cancer; (iii) the ULK1 autophagy kinase in non-small cell lung cancer; and (iv) the ASK1 apoptosis kinase. Finally, Dr. Duckett also has robust research programs evaluating the roles of \u03b2-arrestin1 in GPCR-directed stress signaling and genome maintenance.",
  "research_interests": [
    "Dr. Duckett earned his PhD degree in Biochemistry from the University of Dundee under the mentorship of Professor David M. J. Lilley, a Member of Royal Society and the Director of the Cancer Research UK Nucleic Acid Structure Research Group, where Derek had a remarkable string of studies that defined the structures for DNA and RNA four-way helical junctions, and how these interact with resolving enzymes (Duckett, et al., Cell, 1988, 1995). Derek then was a Howard Hughes Research Fellow in the laboratory of Nobel Laureate Dr. Paul Modrich, where his work established that mismatch repair was the principal repair pathway invoked by DNA damage induced by cytotoxic chemotherapies, including cisplatin and methylating agents (Duckett et al., PNAS, 1996, 1999). Following his fellowship, Dr. Duckett was a Senior Research Scientist at DuPont Pharmaceuticals and then served as a Research Investigator for GlaxoSmithKline from 2000 to 2005, where he directed several clinical kinase inhibitor campaigns, including two that entered Phase I trials. In 2005, Derek joined the Scripps Research Institute (Scripps) as the Associate Director of the Translational Research Institute, where he directed the biology efforts of the High Throughput Screening Facility. In 2009, Dr. Duckett was appointed as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular Therapeutics at Scripps and he was promoted to Associate Professor in 2013. \n  *"
