  "research_interests": [
    "Dr. Byrd completed her Ph.D. in epidemiology at Emory University, where her dissertation research focused on the development and validation of novel, inflammation biomarker panel-weighted dietary and lifestyle inflammation scores, and their associations with colorectal neoplasms. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute, where she was actively involved in conducting multiple studies to establish the best, standard methods for collecting fecal samples for 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic microbiome studies. As a logical next step of this work, she extended her methodological findings to application in etiological investigations of the interrelationships among diet, colonic mucosal and fecal microbes, microbiome-related metabolites, and cancer risk and progression. In January 2021, she joined the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute as an Assistant Member in the Cancer Epidemiology Program, where she is continuing her methodological and etiological microbiome research. Her long-term goal is to use multilevel approaches to address cancer disparities with her etiological diet and microbiome research.\n  *"
