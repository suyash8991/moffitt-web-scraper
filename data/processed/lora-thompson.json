    "I have collaborated with colleagues to examine distress, fatigue, sexual function, and quality of life in cancer patients. I have also initiated research into psychological factors associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) related oropharyngeal cancer and into the use of integrative medicine techniques for cancer symptom control. My current collaborative research has focused on young adults with cancer. I am currently the site PI for the NCI funded Bright IDEAS-Young Adult study of a problem-solving skills training to reduce distress among young adults with cancer. \n  *"
