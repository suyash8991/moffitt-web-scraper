  "research_interests": [
    "Dr. Gonzalez obtained his PhD in Clinical Psychology at the University of South Florida and completed a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Behavioral Oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center. His research focuses on improving cancer survivorship. He aims to develop biopsychosocial models to predict quality of life issues in cancer populations. These models account for the unique contribution of cancer and treatment for cancer. Dr. Gonzalez also develops mobile health (mHealth) behavioral interventions to address quality of life issues among cancer populations. Dr. Gonzalez\u2019s work also aims to reduce disparities in cancer survivorship.\n  *"
