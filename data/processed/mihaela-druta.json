  "overview": "I am a medical oncologist interested in improving the care and outcomes of patients with sarcomas. My areas of focus are clinical care of patients with sarcoma, conducting and developing clinical trials that will improve the outcome of patients with different subtypes of sarcomas and immunotherapy approach in the treatment of sarcomas. I am actively involved in conducting novel immunotherapy trials involving the T cell receptor (TCR) and other immunotherapeutic strategies. I was selected to participate in the first SITC Women in Cancer Immunotherapy Network (WIN) Leadership Institute. This is a unique program that explores topics that benefit female scientists as emerging leaders in the field of cancer immunotherapy. The program is designed to help women to develop and enhance their leadership skills, as well as explore topics around diversity and inclusivity. Female participants from industry, academia and the clinic will be given an opportunity to network with one another and share experiences unique to the female perspective in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Most recently I was selected to participate in the SITC Clinical Immuno-Oncology Network (SCION) Workshop working on an investigator initiated clinical trial involving T-Cell therapy for patients with different subtypes of sarcomas. I earned her MD degree from the University of Medicine and Pharmacy Carol Davila, Romania. I completed an Internal Medicine Residency and Hematology/Medical Oncology Fellowship at the University of South Florida at Moffitt Cancer Center. I completed a Sarcoma Medical Oncology Fellowship (Willie Tichenor Sarcoma Fellowship) at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Dr. Druta's clinical interest is in the development of clinical trials focusing on targeted therapeutics and immunotherapy approach specific to sarcoma patients. My research interest is in the translational aspects of sarcoma biology focusing specifically on Well-differentiated/Differential Liposarcoma, Myxoid Lipsarcoma, Synovial Sarcomas, GIST and Leiomyosarcoma. I am currently a member of several professional associations, including the American Association for Cancer Research, Connective Tissue Oncology Society, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology.",
