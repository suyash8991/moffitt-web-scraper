  "overview": "I am an academic surgical oncologist with a focus on Gastrointestinal Surgical Oncology. In general, my research interests relate to patients with metastatic or advanced GI cancers, with a particular interest in determining the best treatments for patients with peritoneal surface malignancies and in collaborating with scientists at my institution to develop new therapeutics for these diseases. My objective is to continue clinical and translational research at Moffitt Cancer Center, and help find new treatments for my patients that alleviate symptoms and prolong survival.",
  "research_interests": [
    "Dr. Wach\u2019s clinical interests are in treating patients with cancers of the gastrointestinal tract specifically those that spread to the peritoneum using cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy. His research interests are in exploring new therapies for metastatic cancer to the peritoneum and finding ways for better detection and surveillance of peritoneal disease. Additionally, he is interested in multidisciplinary collaborations to develop models to better study metastatic cancer in the preclinical setting.In general, my research interests relate to patients with metastatic or advanced GI cancers, with a particular interest in developing therapeutics for patients with peritoneal surface malignancies. Patients with peritoneal-only metastatic disease have a uniquely aggressive tumor biology and respond differently to treatment than patients with hematogenous metastases. Drug delivery is often more difficult and mucinous components and immunosuppression can inhibit effectiveness. Patients often exhibit significant disability due to malignant ascites, bowel obstruction, and malnutrition and thus have debilitating morbidity and drastically limited survival compared to metastatic disease at other sites (ex. Lungs or liver). Due to difficulties with detecting peritoneal disease on conventional imaging (and thus assessing response to therapies), there is a paucity of research for peritoneal malignancies in comparison to other cancers and fewer active clinical trials. My goal is to help identify new and better treatment options for this underserved patient population that prolong life and alleviate symptoms.\n  *"
