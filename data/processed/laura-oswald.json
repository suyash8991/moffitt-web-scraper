  "research_interests": [
    "Dr. Oswald is a clinical health psychologist whose research focuses on 1) understanding how cancer and its treatments affect patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptom burden, and 2) developing and testing behavioral interventions to improve PROs. Currently, the two primary arms of her research focus on survivorship among patients with multiple myeloma treated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T), a novel immunotherapy, and survivorship among young adults (YAs) diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 18-39. Dr. Oswald is the Principal Investigator an ongoing NIH/NCI R01 study that aims to identify psychosocial and immune-related factors that are associated with key survivorship outcomes in a large, diverse cohort of multiple myeloma CAR-T recipients. Findings from this study will be used to develop patient education materials to inform CAR-T clinical decision-making and to elucidate modifiable targets and critical times to implement behavioral supportive care interventions. Dr. Oswald is also the Principal Investigator of a Department of Defense R01 equivalent study that aims to develop the first behavioral intervention to improve HRQOL for YAs ages 25-39 with advanced cancer and test the feasibility of using a factorial design to identify the most efficacious components of the interventions. Across her work, a common theme is a strong emphasis on team science and multidisciplinary approaches to understand and improve cancer survivorship outcomes.\n  *"
