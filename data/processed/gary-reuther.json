    "My research is focused on characterizing aberrant cellular activities in hematological cancer to identify potential targets for much needed therapeutic strategies for patients. While past focus in the lab has been on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), currently we are interested in understanding the significance of the activation of a protein called JAK2 in a family of blood diseases termed myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). While patients with MPNs have an increased risk of potentially deadly coronary and blood clotting complications, MPNs also transform into AML, which is a steep clinical challenge, even more so than de novo AML. JAK2 is a tyrosine kinase that is deregulated by a variety of genetic mutations that are prevalent in MPNs and when expressed in mouse models induce an MPN-like phenotype. This further indicates JAK2 activity plays an important role in the development of MPNs in humans. However, JAK2 inhibitors have not had a significant effect at eliminating diseased cells from patients and thus do not readily induce remission. Therefore, there remains a need for alternative strategies to target MPN cells in patients. It is possible that combination treatments of JAK2 inhibitors with other small molecule targeted therapies or chemotherapies will provide benefit to MPN patients, and perhaps patients would benefit from novel JAK2 inhibitor-independent approaches. Our research is focused on understanding JAK2 activation and signaling in MPNs and identifying possible alternative therapeutic targets in MPN cells. To this end, we utilize molecular biological, cell biological, biochemical, proteomic, and mouse model approaches to further our understanding of aberrant cell signaling in MPNs and to develop improved JAK2 inhibitors and assess drug combination strategies that may lead to novel therapies to improve the lives of MPN patients.\n  *"
