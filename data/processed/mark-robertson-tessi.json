  "overview": "My research focuses on the integration of mathematical modeling with both experimental and clinical data to deepen our understanding of the dynamic mechanisms at work in cancer. A primary goal of these efforts is to develop decision support tools that leverage longitudinal data to guide personalized therapy.",

    "1) Dynamic clinical decision support frameworks for implementing evolutionary therapies. Many challenges exist to implementing a real-time decision support framework based on large data sets and mathematical modeling. I have been tackling aspects of this problem since my first year at Moffitt, when I helped develop a decision support tool for undetectable breast cancer metastases in the inaugural IMO workshop. More recently, the opportunity to implement these ideas in the clinic became reality with the clinical trial for the Evolutionary Tumor Board (ETB), where mathematical modeling and data analysis are used to generate predictions of patient response to available treatment options. My role in the ETB, which has been enrolling patients since 2020, was to develop and implement novel techniques for using both individual and cohort patient data to predict treatment response and identify alternative optimal strategies for patients. To date, we have enrolled 21 patients in the trial and have developed many novel methods that will serve as the foundation for upcoming evolutionary therapy trials. We are in the process of submitting the first two papers on the ETB, and the approach is extending into a number of new trials in this space, including a multi-institution ETB for pediatric cancers (MCC 22170) of which I am co-PI with Jonathan Metts. 2) Tumor-immune interactions and immunotherapies. Starting with my Ph.D. research and continuing at Moffitt, I have studied the dynamics of immune cells and associated signaling molecules in response to a growing tumor. The complex and dual-edged nature of the immune response, with its pro- and anti-tumor elements, leads to a rich landscape of interactions that benefits from mathematical modeling approaches. Across several diverse tumor-immune models, the repeated observation of personalized \u201cGoldilocks windows\u201d of immunotherapy suggests that there is room to improve the delivery of such treatments in the clinic. 3) Phenotypic heterogeneity, natural selection, and the tumor microenvironment. My major project upon starting as a postdoc was developing a detailed and calibrated mechanistic model of vascular tumor growth, in the context of aerobic glycolysis and acid-mediated invasion. The model included evolving cellular metabolism and a dynamic microenvironment. This work drew upon the interdisciplinary knowledge and data being generated by Moffitt\u2019s Physical Sciences in Oncology U54 center grant. The model predicted many interesting and unintuitive phenomena that were subsequently validated in parallel experimental systems. Several additional studies extended and adapted this model, leading the conceptualization and development of a model-building platform (Hybrid Automata Library, aka HAL) that is now being used in the wider mathematical oncology field. In addition, the model was the basis of the \u2018Cancer Crusade\u2019 mobile game, an NIH funded citizen-science initiative that led to a subsequent collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where we used machine learning approaches to identify optimal treatment policies for patient cohorts.\n  *"
