    "Dr. Alicia Best is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Community and Family Health in the College of Public Health at the University of South Florida (USF). She is a socio-behavioral researcher and certified health education specialist (CHES) with academic training and experience in health education and promotion, health communications, and cancer-related health disparities. Dr. Best earned an MPH in Health Education and Health Promotion from Morehouse School of Medicine, as well as a PhD in Health Promotion, Education, and Behavior and a Certificate of Graduate Study in Health Communications from the University of South Carolina\u2019s Arnold School of Public Health. She also received postdoctoral training in behavioral research with a focus on cancer disparities at the American Cancer Society. Dr. Best conducts original research focused on the role of social and cultural factors in health cognitions, health behaviors, and health-related quality of life. She is also interested in the use of communication strategies to better reach marginalized groups. To this end, her work has focused on mechanisms through which spiritualty impacts the effectiveness of breast cancer screening messages among African American women, as well as how spirituality influences self-rated health among cancer survivors. Her research extends beyond measuring health disparities to the actual implementation and evaluation of interventions designed to improve the health of underserved communities. Prior to joining USF, Dr. Best served as Director of Research and Community Health at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in one of Metropolitan Atlanta\u2019s most disadvantaged neighborhoods. She has extensive experience in community health education, community-engaged research, and health promotion program implementation and evaluation within underserved communities.\n  *"
