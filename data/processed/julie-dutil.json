    "The overall goal of my research program is to understand the contribution of genetic variations to disease susceptibility in the population of Puerto Rico. Breast cancer genetics and genomics: Our team established a breast cancer genetics and genomics program in Puerto Rico. Through this work, we were the first to describe the BRCA mutation spectrum in hereditary breast cancer in this population. In addition, we identified single nucleotide polymorphism conferring increased breast cancer risk in non-hereditary breast cancer cases. Ongoing projects include understanding the role and functional significance of copy number variants in DNA repair candidate genes that are determining the risk of breast cancer, next-gen sequencing of candidate gene for non-BRCA hereditary breast cancers, and the role of ancestry in breast cancer risk and the molecular characteristics of breast cancers in Puerto Rico. Population genetics: We also participated to several collaborative projects aimed at characterizing genetic variation in various populations with the purpose of 1) using this information for improving the design of genetic studies; and 2) understand how population characteristics and migrations shaped the genetic variation spectrum, shared and private of different populations or ethnic groups. In addition, as a result of our participation in the 1000 Genomes project, whole genome sequence data from Puerto Rican individuals and cells lines are publically available to the scientific community for genetics and molecular studies. \n  *"
