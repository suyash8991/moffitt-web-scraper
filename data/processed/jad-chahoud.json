    "Dr. Jad Chahoud\u2019s research is centered on advancing the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), rare genitourinary (GU) cancers, and developing cutting-edge immune and cellular therapies. With over 30 years of expertise in RCC and extensive work on rare GU malignancies, Dr. Chahoud is dedicated to addressing unmet clinical needs through innovative therapeutic approaches and clinical trial design. In RCC, Dr. Chahoud focuses on optimizing personalized treatments through biomarker-driven strategies, aiming to improve outcomes for patients by integrating insights from tumor biology and translational research. His work on rare GU cancers emphasizes increasing treatment options and developing tailored therapeutic protocols for understudied malignancies, leveraging targeted and immunotherapeutic strategies. Dr. Chahoud is also actively involved in immune and cellular therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies, and CAR-T cellular therapies. His research aims to unravel mechanisms of immune escape and enhance the efficacy of immune-based treatments by bridging basic science and clinical research. He emphasizes the importance of novel clinical trial designs to facilitate the translation of scientific discoveries into impactful therapies.\n  *"
