  "overview": "Dr. Mullinax has an active laboratory research effort focused on immunotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma. This approach strives to enhance the patient\u2019s own immune response to cancer and has shown great promise recently for several different subtypes of sarcoma. In his laboratory effort, Dr. Mullinax is working to identify mechanisms and strategies to bring immunotherapy efforts, specifically adoptive cell therapy, to patients with advanced sarcoma.",
  "research_interests": [
    "Dr. Mullinax studies the immune infiltrate in soft tissue sarcoma with the goal of developing adoptive cell therapy for patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Currently, he has a large research protocol which involves the study of resected sarcoma specimens. Specialized immune cells within the tumor which have the ability to attack tumor cells, called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), are grown from the tumor in his lab and studied. Through the study of these cells, we are understanding the underlying mechanisms of tumor-immune interaction that will be used to develop novel therapies for patients with advanced sarcoma. He is a part of a larger team at Moffitt focused on this strategy for several other tumor types and the collaboration between this team is yielding very promising results for patients. His work is currently funded by the Ocala Royal Dames, the Chotiner Family Foundation and an Interdisciplinary Mathematical Oncology (IMO) Department grant.\n  *"
