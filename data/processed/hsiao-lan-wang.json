    "I have two research focuses. One is to improve head and neck cancer survivorship through a multidisciplinary and transitional approach. My current study is to understand whether a 10-week physical activity program can improve multiple symptoms. This program uses the existing Wii Fit software with a tailored Wii Fit routine prescribed by a personal trainer. The advisory board members designing this program include senior nursing scientists, a head and neck nurse practitioner, exercise physiologist, occupation therapist, and physical therapist. We are still waiting for follow up data collection of symptoms and planning on moving this study to the Moffitt Cancer Center. The second research focus is to promote colon cancer screening adherence. I have participated in a study that uses computer-tailored intervention to improve colon cancer screening adherence. I have participated in a study that uses computer-tailored intervention to improve colon cancer screening participations among African Americans (R01; PI; Susan M. Rawl). Currently, I am developing a manuscript to describe predictors of colon cancer screening stage of adoption among non-adherent African Americans. Grant development focusing on this area with a different population (e.g. Hispanics) will be anticipated in the future.\n  *"
