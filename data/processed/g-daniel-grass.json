  "overview": "Dr. Grass is focused on treating patients with genitourinary malignancies by implementing novel approaches with leading edge radiation technologies and using imaging and tumor genomics in the decision-making process. He is also interested in multi-disciplinary care models in bladder cancer, which provide patients the opportunity to hear the best treatment options available before deciding on a treatment approach.",
  "research_interests": [
    "Dr. Grass is interested in personalizing the approach to radiation therapy delivery by integrating patient-specific tumor genomics, metabolism and host-immune system interactions. He also has an interest in rare genitourinary cancers, including small cell cancer of the bladder and penile cancer, and identifying novel treatment approaches for these aggressive tumor types.\n  *"
