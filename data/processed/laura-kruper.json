  "overview": "As a breast oncology fellowship-trained surgeon, the focus of my research is improving the delivery of care to breast cancer patients as well as addressing health care disparities. During the research portion of my surgical residency, I received a T32 National Research Service Award grant to pursue a Masters in Clinical Epidemiology (MSCE). My background in cancer epidemiology and outcomes research has provided me with the skills to conduct outcomes studies and participate in translational research projects. I have spent my career in academic Cancer Centers, first City of Hope and now Moffitt. I am actively engaged in clinical research and participate in clinical trials. I am particularly interested in the de-escalation of care in the treatment of breast cancer, using immunotherapy and vaccines to decrease breast tumor size in order to reduce toxic chemotherapies or offer less extensive surgeries. My research and clinical focus is de-escalating systemic breast cancer treatment, while bringing new technologies and therapies to breast cancer surgery to minimize toxicities and improve outcomes.",

    "I was an active participant in accruing to the Selene Perimeter Device Trial (Perimeter MCC 21937) and accrued a total of 9 patients in 2024 to the trial. I am the Site Principal Investigator for the Agendia FLEX Registry trial slated to open July 2025. The purpose study is to create a large-scale, population-based database to better understand the biology, treatment and outcomes of breast cancer patients, enrolling patients for whom MammaPrint\u00ae and BluePrint\u2122 have been ordered to guide treatment decisions, MammaPrint\u00ae is an FDA cleared test used clinically to determine a patient\u2019s risk for distant metastasis and is used to guide treatment decisions. BluePrint\u2122 provides physicians with more information about an individual\u2019s breast cancer\u2019s biology. I will also be the Site PI for I-SPY's DCIS RECAST Study, slated for Fall 2025. This study is to determine whether 6 months of neoadjuvant exposure to novel endocrine therapy for women with ductal cell carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will increase the fraction of patients suitable for long-term active surveillance without surgery. The patients will be randomized to either standard neoendocrine therapies (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) or novel therapies (endoxifen, elacestrant, testosterone + anastrazole pellet). My research interests include being able to employ large databases (cancer registries, population databases) to answer relevant questions to breast cancer care as therapies and treatments evolve over time. In 2024, I was granted access to the National Cancer Database (NCDB) and obtained the Participant User Files (PUF) with the hope to examine the interplay of de-escalation of specific breast cancer treatments and subsequent escalation of other breast cancer tests and/or therapies. However, 2024 was the first year that NCDB decided they will no longer code for STATA, the one statististical program I know. I am planning on collaborating with one of the sarcoma surgeons who was recently hired who is familiar with using SAS. \n  *"
