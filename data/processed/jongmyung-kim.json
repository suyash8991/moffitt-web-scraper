    "My research focuses on developing and translating novel theranostic strategies to overcome therapeutic resistance in primary and metastatic lung cancer. I employ phage display technologies to identify and engineer tumor-specific peptides for peptide-directed immuno-radiotherapy, radiopharmaceuticals, and bispecific antibody platforms designed to enhance tumor targeting and immune modulation. In parallel, my work investigates radiation-guided immune modulation as a synergistic approach to amplify anti-tumor immunity and sensitize resistant cancers to therapy. By integrating genomics-driven precision oncology, I aim to define molecular drivers of resistance and tumor heterogeneity, and translate these insights into clinical trial designs that accelerate the delivery of personalized cancer care. Central to my efforts is the advancement of innovative combinations of radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and novel biologics through multidisciplinary collaborations, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for patients with advanced or treatment-refractory lung cancers.\n  *"
