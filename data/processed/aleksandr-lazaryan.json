  "overview": "Dr. Lazaryan has clinical and research expertise in complications of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BMT) such as chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and Cellular Immunotherapy of lymphoid malignancies (non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin Lymphomas) with focus on Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD) and toxicities of CAR T cell therapy. His research efforts focus on developing safer and more effective approaches for CAR T-cell utilization and exploring new therapies for chronic GVHD and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). In recognition of his work, Dr. Lazaryan has secured funding from prestigious organizations, including the NIH's Chronic GVHD Consortium and the US Department of Defense, which awarded him a grant to study immune responses in aggressive lymphomas and PTLD.",
  "research_interests": [
    "Dr. Lazaryan completed his post-graduate medical training in Internal Medicine and Hematology/Medical Oncology at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio followed by the faculty appointment in Blood and Marrow Transplantation and hematological malignancies at the University of Minnesota. He also obtained Masters and PhD in Public Health from the State University of NY at Albany and University of Alabama in Birmingham, respectively. Since joining Moffitt in 2018, Dr. Lazaryan has been focusing his clinical and research expertise in managing complex patients with lymphoma who are in need for BMT and/or cellular immunotherapy such as CAR T cell therapy. Dr. Lazaryan has been the recipient of a research grant from the US Department of Defense to study immune responses in patients with aggressive lymphomas including recipients of solid organ transplant. He has published over 100 peer-reviewed research manuscripts in leading professional journals.\n  *"
