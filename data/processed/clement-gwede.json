  "research_interests": [
    "Despite major advances in cancer screening, early detection and care, there are marked and persistent disparities in outcomes for African-Americans/Blacks and other medically underserved populations. As such, over the past few years Dr. Gwede's research has spanned the continuum of cancer care with the following broad goals: reducing cancer disparities through community-based interventions to promote informed decision making and early detection for prostate and colorectal cancer; increasing participation of racial-ethnic minorities in clinical research; and symptom management interventions to improve quality of life during and after cancer treatment. Supported by grants from the ACS and NCI, current research by Dr. Gwede and colleagues uses community-based participatory research methods and community-academic partnerships to develop and implement culturally targeted, linguistically and literacy relevant interventions to increase colorectal cancer screening among diverse medically underserved populations in community health clinics and other community settings. In the area of symptom management and quality of life, Dr. Gwede seeks to prevent or ameliorate the burden of debilitating chemoradiation-induced symptoms in national or multinational cooperative clinical trials. \n  *"
