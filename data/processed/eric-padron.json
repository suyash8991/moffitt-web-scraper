  "overview": "The Padron Lab explores how to combat leukemia by investigating different drugs available for treatment, novel combinations of available drugs, or researching the non-coding genome. Investigating the non-coding part of the human genome is important. Another area of the Padron Lab is looking at what happens to patients before they get leukemia to identify any genetic risk factors. One of these Padron is investigating is an entity called clonal hematopoiesis. Clonal hematopoiesis puts older individuals at much higher risk of getting leukemia, but also puts them at higher risk for cardiovascular disease.",
  "research_interests": [
    "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare hematopoeitic malignancy characterized by dysplasia, cytopenias, a propensity to transform to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and a characteristic monocytosis that defines this entity. In the past, CMML was grouped together with the Myelodysplasitc Syndromes (MDS) but its clinical and genetic behavior is now known to be distinctly different from MDS. As a result, this disease is now grouped in a separate MDS/MPN category by WHO. Our research interests focus on understanding the molecular and genetic pathway of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia to better design targeted agents for study in the clinic. Our previous efforts have identified the GM-CSF signaling cascade as a target for CMML therapeutics and current efforts are underway to test this in the clinic. Future work will focus on uncovering new targets for CMML specific therapies. Dr. Padron has developed an interest in working with existing pharmaceutical compounds to evaluate their effectiveness for bone marrow failure disorders. Other work Dr. Padron is pursuing involves the SRSF2 mutation that can occur in MDS and may be related to progression to other diseases. The research underway examines the ability of an existing compound in development to destroy leukemic cells through targeting the cell's RNA. Positive results from these studies would be a benefit to patients in reducing the symptoms of bone marrow failure diseases, in particular the constitutional symptoms that can distress patients, including enlarged spleen, weight loss and fevers.\n  *"
