    "Dr. Poch's research interests include health-related quality of life outcomes after oncologic surgery with a focus on post-operative body image and mental health assessments. His current research projects include assessment of patient-centered treatment preferences for urinary diversion after bladder removal surgery. In addition, he is involved in active enrollment of patients to Moffitt sponsored clinical trials. Additional research interests include immunotherapy for bladder cancer, specifically evaluating the potential growth and expansion of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.\n  *"
