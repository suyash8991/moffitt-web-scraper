  "overview": "Vani Simmons, Ph.D. serves as the Director of the Tobacco Research and Intervention Program and as the Assistant Center Director of Community Outreach and Engagement. Her research focuses on the development of targeted smoking cessation and relapse-prevention interventions for special populations (at-risk/vulnerable groups), including cancer patients, college students, and racial/ethnic minorities. Smoking among cancer patients can result in numerous adverse health consequences. Dr. Simmons and her team have developed a line of research to create a novel, theory-based smoking-relapse prevention intervention for cancer patients. Recently, her work has expanded to electronic cigarette use among cancer patients and dual users. Dr. Simmons is also committed to understanding barriers and facilitators to low-dose computed tomography as a screening tool for high-risk smokers. Dr. Simmons has also conducted research on the development of culturally appropriate smoking relapse \u00adprevention and cessation intervention materials for Hispanic smokers and she recently led a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a Spanish-\u00adlanguage self-help smoking cessation intervention for Hispanic smokers. Another burgeoning area of research for Dr. Simmons involves mobile health approaches for smoking cessation. Her research has been funded by the National Cancer Institute, Florida Department of Health James and Esther King Biomedical Research Program, as well as other foundations.",
