  "research_interests": [
    "The Brady-Nicholls lab is focused on improving patient care using accessible, minimally-invasive biomarkers through the integration of mathematical modeling, with a special interest on improving outcomes for underrepresented minorities. To accomplish this, we develop predictive mathematical models of these biomarker dynamics that propose patient-tailored treatment strategies that maximize patient response and quality of life.\n  *"
