    "Dr. Daley is a behavioral scientist whose research interests center on aspects of cancer screening and prevention, specifically, the connection between the sexually transmitted infection human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical, anal and oral cancer. Dr. Daley is directing a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded study in an inter-programmatic collaboration with Anna Giuliano, PhD, of the Cancer Epidemiology Program, looking at the cognitive and emotional responses to HPV testing in men. Among the outcomes of interest are men\u2019s willingness to disclose their test results to their partners, encourage their partners to receive a Pap smear, and consider receiving a vaccination against HPV. She has also conducted research related to HPV\u2019s role in oral cancers, specifically looking at the knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of oral health providers towards the HPV vaccine.\n  *"
