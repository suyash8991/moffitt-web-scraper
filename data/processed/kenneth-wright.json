  "overview": "Dr. Wright\u2019s laboratory research interests are on understanding the molecular and epigenetic vulnerabilities in hematologic malignancies including B cell lymphoma, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and myelodysplastic syndromes. His research focuses on revealing new potential therapeutic targets and therapeutic combinations. Dr. Wright also has a focus on health disparities and leads a U54 NCI PACHE grant supporting decreasing health disparities though education and training, community outreach, and scientific research. This research program is a partnership with Ponce Health Sciences University in Ponce Puerto Rico.",
  "research_interests": [
    "My primary research interest is in understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning hematologic malignancies and developing approaches that preserve and enhance immune function while killing tumor cells. This work includes investigations into the activity of NK cells in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) patients and the significance of a select protein deacetylase enzyme activity in response to treatment. My laboratory has expanding interest in defining therapeutic targets in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by characterizing the bone marrow microenvironment, the role of MDSCs, and the impact of novel inhibitors targeting critical signaling pathways in MDS. We also have interest in understanding the origin and role of aberrantly produced RNA:DNA hybrids and the Fat Mass And Obesity Associated gene (FTO) in driving the MDS disease. I have strong interest in decreasing health disparities and lead the NCI U54 PACHE partnership grant with Ponce Health Sciences University which focuses on education and training, community outreach, and scientific research support addressing the Hispanic/Latino population. \n  *"
