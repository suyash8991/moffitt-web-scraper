  "overview": "Dr. Grogan's research focus involves evaluating novel therapeutic strategies for high-grade gliomas, both preclinically and clinically, and understanding disease growth characteristics as they relate to molecular driver alterations that can impact the treatment approaches as well as heterogeneity amongst tumors as well as implications for immunocellular therapy. Specifically, Dr. Grogan co-heads the Moffitt Glioma Translation Glioma Program with a focus on preclinical modeling of novel drug delivery strategies and novel agents for the treatment of gliomas as well as the identification of targets for immune-targeted approaches. He is actively working to expand glioma/glioblastoma and meningioma clinical trial access at Moffitt in conjunction with the Neuro-Oncology, Neurosurgery, and Radiation Oncology teams to provide patients with unique opportunities to receive promising new therapies before those options are made widely available.",

    "Dr. Grogan\u2019s research interests involve preclinical disease modeling and therapeutic targeting in primary central nervous system tumors, specifically high-grade gliomas like glioblastoma, as well as exploring clinical observations that drive disease behavior and treatment decisions. He has a specific interested in understanding glioblastoma heterogeneity and clonality in the setting of temozolomide chemotherapy resistance and how this disease evolution can be overcome with novel therapeutic strategies and precision-based approaches. Dr. Grogan co-heads the Moffitt Glioma Translation Glioma Program with a focus on preclinical modeling of novel drug delivery strategies and novel agents for the treatment of gliomas as well as the identification of targets for immune-targeted approaches. Recurrent gliomas including glioblastoma have limited effective therapeutic options, but 5-15% demonstrate hypermutation, usually following temozolomide exposure. This leads to a heterogeneic mutational landscape and variable neoantigenicity that is sometimes but not always associated with mismatch repair deficiency. Despite this hypermutation, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibition has remained disappointing, much in contrast to non-CNS hypermutant malignancies. One component of Dr. Grogan\u2019s research involves development of a CRISPR-based modifiable murine model of hypermutation-associated clonality/subclonality to evaluate pressured and unpressured selection which will allow for better prospective understanding of immune editing in the setting of disease heterogeneity. In addition to the evolving mutational profiles amongst hypermutant gliomas, he will be characterizing expression adaptation following temozolomide-induced hypermutation with the goal of using bioinformatics to better identify replicable changes that are known to promote immune activation/suppression; using knock-out/knock-down modeling, this can subsequently identify therapeutic targets to enhance immune recognition of these tumors. In addition, Dr. Grogan has an interested in improved drug delivery mechanisms, repurposing of small molecular inhibitors for synergistic strategies, and exploration of novel molecular targets for high-grade gliomas like glioblastoma along with application and development of novel immunocellular therapeutic strategies in this realm with a focus on IDH mutant tumors. As a clinician-investigator, he is working to facilitate translation of novel treatment options into clinic trials for patients with gliomas.\n  *"
